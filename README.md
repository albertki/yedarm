# Student-Parent Database Website

Dynamic database website developed using Node.js, Mongoose, and MongoDB. Authentication and authorization integrated using Passport.js.

Images are stored and managed on **Cloudinary**. Data for students, parents, and users are stored and managed using **MongoDB Atlas**.
 **Free accounts for both services can be created on their respective sites.**

Prior to running this application, please make sure the required node packages are installed:
From the root directory:
`npm i` 

For testing, the node web application can be run with any of the following:
`npm start`, or
`node app.js`,
or, if you have `nodemon` installed:
`nodemon app.js`.


*I wrote and designed this web application from scratch for use by a local tutoring program for students with special needs. The site has proved to be of significant help for the program's administrators and offered ease of usage by the common end-user(s).*

*Please feel free to pull this project and re-design/re-implement, improve, and deploy this web application for your personal use.*
